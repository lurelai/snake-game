# What it is?
This is the "snake game" made with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript by the zero

# What was the purpose?
The purpose was tested me, actually I'm wanting to start to learn Node.js, but I think that I don't have the necessary at this moment to continue with it, so, I am trying to better my range of knowledge in JavaScript now.

# My conclusions
In generally, I'm not satisfied with it, there are a lot of bugs that I am not able to solve, but, the fact that it is working is enough for now. I search a little about how can I do it better, and for now I will learn about OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) and JavaScript's MAP

# Assessment
4/10 â‡¾ There is a lot to improve
